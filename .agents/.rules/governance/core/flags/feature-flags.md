# Feature Flags — Conditional Governance Activation

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Normative
Scope: `.agents/governance/**`

This document defines feature flags that control which governance subsystems
are active. Flags enable gradual adoption — new projects can start with
minimal governance and enable subsystems as they mature.

Inspired by feature flag systems that gate runtime behavior through a
layered override model.

## 1) Flag Catalog

| Flag                     | Default | Scope   | Description                                                     |

## 2) Override Precedence

Flags are resolved in the following priority order (highest wins):

1. **Session-level override** — Explicit agent instruction for this session.
   _Example_: "Disable strict_review for this task."
2. **Project-level** — Set in root `AGENTS.md` project definitions.
   _Example_: `strict_review: OFF` for a prototype repo.
3. **Global** — Set in `.agents/AGENTS.md` or this file.
4. **Default** — The value in the table above.

### Override Syntax

In root `AGENTS.md`, flags are overridden under the project definitions:

```markdown
## 5) Feature Flag Overrides

| Flag                   | Value |
| :--------------------- | :---: |
| `strict_review`        |  OFF  |
| `memory_consolidation` |  ON   |
```

---

## 3) Flag Semantics

### ON

The governance subsystem is active. All rules from the referenced document
are enforced.

### OFF

The governance subsystem is inactive. Its rules are still documented but
not enforced. The agent MAY note when it would have triggered a disabled
gate:

```
ℹ️ Note: strict_review is disabled for this project.
   Would have triggered multi-pass review for this change.
```

---

## 4) Feature-Gate Lifecycle

All non-trivial flags should be managed as feature gates with an explicit
lifecycle instead of permanent ad hoc toggles.

Use these maturity stages:

| Stage        | Intended Use                       | Default Posture                             | Compatibility Promise                |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `Alpha`      | internal proving and narrow pilots | OFF                                         | no compatibility guarantee           |
| `Beta`       | broader validation in real repos   | explicit opt-in or carefully chosen default | config shape should stabilize        |
| `GA`         | standard reusable capability       | ON or policy-driven                         | safe to depend on operationally      |
| `Deprecated` | scheduled removal                  | keep current behavior but warn              | replacement and sunset date required |
| `Removed`    | no longer available                | OFF and ignored                             | references must be cleaned up        |

Shared baseline flags in this file should be treated as `GA` unless explicitly
marked otherwise by a future update.

Project-local flags should declare at least:

- `name`
- `stage`
- `owner`
- `default`
- `introduced`
- `affected surfaces`
- `rollback or kill-switch path`
- `expiry review date` for `Alpha` and `Beta`

---

## 5) Compatibility And Disabled-Path Rules

Enterprise-grade feature gates must fail predictably.

- A disabled gate must remove, ignore, or reject its gated behavior in a stable
  way.
- If a gate controls schema, generated adapters, or API surface, disabled fields
  should be dropped before validation or omitted from generated output.
- A repo must not document an `Alpha` path as the default operational baseline.
- Installers, scaffolds, and adapters must not silently assume a gated feature
  exists when the gate is OFF.
- If a gate affects security, approval, or trust behavior, OFF must never widen
  privilege by accident.

This is the same operational idea used by mature platforms: gate behavior must
be explicit both when enabled and when disabled.

---

## 6) Immutable Flags

Some flags cannot be set to OFF by project-level overrides. They can only
be disabled at session-level by explicit human instruction:

| Flag                     | Reason                                 |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `dangerous_op_detection` | Core safety — never disable by default |
| `security_gates`         | Core safety — never disable by default |
| `evidence_required`      | Audit trail integrity                  |

---

## 7) Flag Dependencies

Some flags have upstream dependencies. If the upstream flag is OFF, the
downstream flag is implicitly OFF regardless of its own setting:

```
hooks_enabled ──► memory_extraction (PostTask hook fires extraction)
hooks_enabled ──► auto_backlog_update (PostTask hook fires update)
hooks_enabled ──► continuous_learning (PostToolUse hook fires observation capture)
continuous_learning ──► instincts_enabled (no learning input → no instinct generation)
memory_extraction ──► memory_consolidation (no extractions → nothing to consolidate)
memory_extraction ──► memory_injection (no extractions → nothing to inject)
approval_required ──► auto_approval_rules (no approval → rules unused)
```

---

## 8) Flag Review And Retirement

Every `Alpha`, `Beta`, or `Deprecated` flag should be reviewed on a defined
cadence.

At review time, choose one:

1. promote to the next stage
2. keep current stage with a new review date and explicit reason
3. deprecate and define a migration path
4. remove the gate and clean dependent docs, scaffolds, adapters, and tests

Flags become governance debt when they no longer represent a real decision.
Dead flags should be removed, not left as ceremonial switches.
