# System Rules - Sub-Agent Orchestration

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Normative
Scope: `.agents/**`

This document defines the core system rules for the sub-agent orchestration.

---

## 1) Codex is NOT Default

**Codex is a specialist, NOT a secretary.**

Codex (the strong/executor model) MUST NOT be the default agent for every task.
It should ONLY be used when:

- Implementation is required (feature, bugfix, refactor)
- Repo-wide reasoning is needed
- Final integration of multiple inputs is required
- Technical review with strong judgment is needed

Codex MUST NOT be used for:

- Code mapping / file discovery
- First documentation read
- CI log summarization
- File search
- Task classification
- "Tell me what happens here" exploratory tasks

---

## 2) Two Modes of Operation

### Explore Mode (Read-Only)

**When to use:**

- Mapping codebase structure
- Finding relevant files
- Researching documentation
- CI log analysis
- Any task without code changes

**Characteristics:**

- Use cheap/fast models (gpt-4o-mini)
- No code modifications
- Returns artifact with file references
- Budget: 2,000-3,000 tokens

### Execute Mode (Write)

**When to use:**

- Implementing features
- Bug fixes
- Significant refactoring
- Multi-file changes
- Tasks that require code changes

**Characteristics:**

- Use strong model (gpt-4o, Claude, etc.)
- Code modifications allowed
- Returns artifact with code_changes
- Budget: 10,000-15,000 tokens

---

## 3) Four Core Roles

| Role                  | Mode    | Trust Tier | Model       | Purpose                         |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Supervisor/Router** | -       | -          | -           | Routes tasks, orchestrates flow |
| **Mapper**            | Explore | T0         | gpt-4o-mini | Map code, find files            |
| **Researcher**        | Explore | T0         | gpt-4o-mini | Docs, API, external research    |
| **Executor**          | Execute | T1         | gpt-4o      | Implement, fix, refactor        |
| **Reviewer**          | -       | T0         | gpt-4o      | Review changes, identify risks  |

---

## 4) Routing Rules

### Automatic Routing by Task Type

| Task Pattern                                                   | First Agent         | Next Agent                        |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| "map / where / how does / find / explore / trace / understand" | Mapper              | Executor if code change needed    |
| "docs / documentation / API / version / learn about"           | Researcher          | Executor if implementation needed |
| "CI / build / deploy / failed / log / test failure"            | Researcher + CI MCP | Executor if fix needed            |
| "implement / fix / refactor / change / modify / add / create"  | Executor            | Reviewer                          |
| "review / check / verify / audit / risks"                      | Reviewer            | (end)                             |

### If Task is Unclear:

**Always** send to Mapper first. Never start with Executor.

---

## 5) Context Budget Rules

### Per-Agent Limits

| Agent      | Max Files | Max Tokens | Max Goals |
| :--------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-------- |
| Mapper     | 10        | 2,000      | 1         |
| Researcher | 5         | 3,000      | 1         |
| Executor   | 20        | 15,000     | 1         |
| Reviewer   | 15        | 5,000      | 1         |

### Supervisor Rules:

- NEVER pass entire repo to any agent
- ALWAYS pass pruned context
- ALWAYS include `relevant_files` in brief
- ALWAYS include `acceptance_criteria`

---

## 6) Model Selection

### Default Models

| Task Type         | Recommended Model |
| :---------------- | :---------------- |
| Mapper / Explorer | gpt-4o-mini       |
| Researcher / Docs | gpt-4o-mini       |
| Executor / Code   | gpt-4o            |
| Reviewer          | gpt-4o            |

### Override via Environment:

```bash
export AGENT_HARNESS_MODEL_MAPPER="gpt-4o-mini"
export AGENT_HARNESS_MODEL_EXECUTOR="gpt-4o"
export AGENT_HARNESS_MODEL_REVIEWER="gpt-4o"
```

## 7) Trust Tier Enforcement

| Tier   | Role                         | Access          | Default                  |
| :----- | :--------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- |
| **T0** | Mapper, Researcher, Reviewer | Read-only       | All agents default to T0 |
| **T1** | Executor                     | Workspace write | Only for execute tasks   |
| **T2** | (Future)                     | External write  | Requires human approval  |

Default: If not specified, treat as T0 (no write).

---

## 8) Human Approval Gates

Tasks requiring human approval:

- External write operations (T2+)
- Production deployments
- Secret modifications
- Dependency additions
- Any `external_write` action

Before any T2 operation:

1. Supervisor requests approval
2. Human must explicitly approve
3. Only then proceed to Executor

---

## 9) Metrics & Success Measurement

Track these metrics:

| Metric                   | Description                             |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `tasks_without_codex`    | Tasks resolved without calling Executor |
| `tasks_with_codex`       | Tasks that required Executor            |
| `avg_codex_input_tokens` | Average token input to Executor         |
| `routing_accuracy`       | How often first agent was correct       |
| `failed_artifacts`       | Artifacts that failed validation        |

Success goal: **Reduce Executor calls by 60%+**
