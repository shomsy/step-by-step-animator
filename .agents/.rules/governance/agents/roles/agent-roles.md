# Agent Roles & Delegation — Specialized Agent Personas

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Normative
Scope: `.agents/governance/**`

This document defines the specialized agent roles available within the Agent
Harness OS. Roles provide structured personas with scoped responsibilities,
enabling focused, high-quality outputs at each stage of the SDLC.

Inspired by MetaGPT's `Code = SOP(Team)` philosophy where software is produced
by materializing Standard Operating Procedures and applying them to teams
of specialized agents, and ECC's 36 specialized agents with YAML-defined
capabilities and permissions.

---

## 1) Core Principle: Code = SOP(Team)

Software quality is maximized when each role:

1. Has a **single, clear responsibility**
2. Produces **structured output** that serves as input to the next role
3. Follows a **defined SOP** (Standard Operating Procedure)
4. Operates within its **declared trust tier**

## 3) Role Invocation Protocol

### Declaration

When operating in a specific role, the agent SHOULD declare it:

```
Operating as: reviewer
```

This is **advisory**, not prescriptive — agents may operate in multiple roles
during a single task. The declaration helps with:

- Audit trail (which role produced which output)
- Trust tier enforcement (role constrains available permissions)
- SOP compliance (role-specific checklists apply)

### Role Transitions

An agent may transition between roles within a task:

```
[planner] → Decomposed task into 4 subtasks
[architect] → Designed API contract for auth module
[implementer] → Writing implementation...
[reviewer] → Self-reviewing before submission
```

### Single-Agent Mode

When only one agent instance is available, it cycles through roles
sequentially, following the workflow pipeline defined in
`workflow-pipelines.md`.

### Multi-Agent Mode

When multiple agent instances are available, roles can be parallelized:

- planner + architect can work simultaneously on different tasks
- reviewer MUST NOT be the same instance as implementer (separation of
  concerns)

---

## 4) Sequential Handoff Protocol

Inspired by MetaGPT's structured document passing:

```
planner ──[TODO.md]──► architect ──[design.md]──► implementer
                                                       │
                                                  [source code]
                                                       │
                                              tester ◄─┘
                                                │
                                          [test results]
                                                │
                                         reviewer ◄─┘
                                                │
                                        [review findings]
                                                │
                                        documenter ◄─┘
                                                │
                                          [docs + changelog]
                                                │
                                         releaser ◄─┘
```

### Handoff Requirements

Each handoff MUST include:

1. **Structured artifact**: The output document from the previous role
2. **Completion signal**: Confirmation that the role's SOP is complete
3. **Evidence**: Timestamped proof of work (per `quality-gates.md`)

---

## 5) Custom Roles

Projects MAY define custom roles in their root `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Custom Agent Roles

### Data Analyst

| Attribute          | Value                                            |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Responsibility** | Data analysis, visualization, insight generation |
| **Trust Tier**     | T1                                               |
| **SOP Input**      | Data sources, analysis requirements              |
| **SOP Output**     | Analysis report, visualizations                  |
```

Custom roles:

- MUST declare a trust tier
- MUST define SOP inputs and outputs
- MUST NOT override core role definitions
- MAY extend the sequential handoff chain

## 6) Relationship to Other Standards

| Standard                  | Relationship                                         |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `approval-policy.md`      | Trust tier per role determines approval requirements |
| `workflow-pipelines.md`   | Defines the sequence in which roles execute          |
| `hooks-policy.md`         | `PreTask` hook assigns the initial role              |
| `quality-gates.md`        | Each role has role-specific quality gates            |
| `how-to-code-review.md`   | Reviewer role follows these review standards         |
| `how-to-strict-review.md` | Security reviewer follows strict review              |
| `execution-policy.md`     | Task lane maps to starting role                      |
