# Learning Config

This file documents the default operating thresholds for the reusable learning
runtime.

| Key                       | Default | Meaning                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :-----: | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `observe_max_lines`       | `50000` | Maximum lines before observation archive rotation       |
| `observe_archive_batch`   | `25000` | Number of oldest lines moved during rotation            |
| `detect_min_occurrences`  |   `3`   | Minimum repeated pattern count before instinct creation |
| `detect_max_evidence`     |   `5`   | Evidence samples written into each instinct file        |
| `detect_cooldown_seconds` |  `60`   | Minimum time between automated analysis passes          |

Projects MAY override these thresholds locally if their scale or tooling needs
justify it.
